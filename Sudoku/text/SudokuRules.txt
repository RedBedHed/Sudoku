Rules:

The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. 
The grid is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares.
The rules of the game are simple: each of the nine blocks has to 
contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. 

Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box.
The difficulty lies in that each vertical nine-square column, 
or horizontal nine-square line across, within the larger square, 
must also contain the numbers 1-9, without repetition or omission. 
Every puzzle has just one correct solution.

To place a number in an empty box, first left-click on the box to
highlight it, then select a number from the bar beside the grid.

To place a guess (hint) in an empty box, right-click on the box to
highlight it, then select a number from the bar beside the grid.

To de-select a box, simply click on any box that is already filled.
Selecting another empty box will also de-select the selected box.

To remove a guess from a box, right-click the box twice.
